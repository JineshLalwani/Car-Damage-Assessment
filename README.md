In Car Insurance industry, a lot of money is being wasted on Claims leakage. Claims leakage is the gap between the optimal and actual settlement of a claim. Visual inspection and validation are being used to reduce claims leakage. But doing inspection might take a long time and result in delaying of claims processing. An automated system for doing inspection and validation will be of great help in speeding up the process.

To solve these problems we used few deep learning model.

Leveraged advanced deep learning techniques, employing YOLO for object detection and VGG16 for preciseobject classification within car damage assessment.

Utilized Roboflow for data preprocessing and augmentation, effectively enhancing model accuracy and performance.

Achieved a notable improvement in object detection accuracy using YOLO, elevating mean Average Precisionat 50% Intersection over Union (mAP50) to 0.706, a significant enhancement of approximately 10%.

The primary objective was to automate the car damage assessment process, aiming to minimize claims

leakage during insurance processing, thus streamlining and improving efficiency in claims handling.
